# A VOIR 
- Mettre un path générique pour le loading des embeddings cifar + remove old paths 
- Ratio définissant la classe minoritaire pour l'évaluation du F-Score : Line 300 main_run.py -> if (counts[label_id] / sum) <= (0.2 / n_classes):
- Supprimer le folder 'datasets' qui corresponds au folder de recherche de datasets avec d'anciens scripts sales (old runs + suppression cat features) ?
- Supprimer folder best model ?


## Datasets characteristics

### 1461 - bank-marketing
https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=1461

Bank Marketing
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

number of instances	45211
number of classes	2
number of features	17
number of numeric features	7

Model used : Random Forest

### 1471 - eeg-eye-state
https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&id=1471

All data is from one continuous EEG measurement with the Emotiv EEG Neuroheadset. 
The eye state was detected via a camera during the EEG measurement and added later manually to the file after analyzing the video frames. '1' indicates the eye-closed and '0' the eye-open state.
